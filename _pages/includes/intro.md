# 😊 About me
Hello! I’m Yaning Yang, a Lecturer at the School of Computer Science, Xiangtan University. I got my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Technology from Hunan University in 2023, under the guidance of the amazing Prof. [Shaoliang Peng](https://csee.hnu.edu.cn/people/pengshaoliang).


My work lives at the crossroads of high-performance computing, large language models, and bioinformatics. Lately, I’ve been fascinated by how we can teach large language models to “speak genomics” — making sense of complex multi-omics data and uncovering the hidden stories behind genomic structural variants.

I’ve been lucky to publish papers in journals and conferences like TPDS, Briefings in Bioinformatics, Bioinformatics, Nature Machine Intelligence, and IEEE BIBM. But honestly, I’m most excited about what comes next: building smarter, faster, and more interpretable AI for biology and medicine. 🚀
